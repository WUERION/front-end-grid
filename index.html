        looking to make a transition and have
        heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course end found it
        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
        life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
        startup."</p>

      <p class="text-[--Very-dark-grayish-blue] opacity-[70%]">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line
        of code. I needed some srtucture from professionals who
        can help me learn programing step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only
        say wonderful things about the program. The entri curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
        hansd-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It
        took my learning to the nect in a way that on tuturial could ever have. In fact, I've pften referred to it
        during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly halped me land a job as a full-stack
        developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommende!"</p>
